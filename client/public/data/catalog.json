      "description": "Caledonia doesn't fit in a box nicely, and we like it that way. It was conceived on our Thursday night rides—routes that often play fast and loose with road ride. As we tried to stuff bigger tires into our R5s and streamline our Asperos, a new kind of bike was born. When we design a bike, we start with our library of tube shapes. These shapes are tubes we've used on other models that we know to have various qualities—aerodynamic, stiff, ultralight, etc.—and they help get us to the refinement stage on a bike more quickly. In the case of Caledonia, we wanted durability, lightweight, and aerodynamics to be in balance and selected a package that achieved the performance demands of this kind of race bike.",
